          Our breeding decisions are based on measurable criteria including genetic testing, pedigree analysis, structural evaluation, temperament assessment, and lifelong health monitoring.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Animals produced within our program remain in continuous follow-up, allowing us to track growth, fertility, longevity, and disease outcomes across generations.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This allows us to not only produce high-quality animals, but to refine breeding and nutrition practices using real-world results rather than assumptions.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Our goal is to bridge responsible breeding with evidence-based husbandry, turning daily animal management into meaningful biological understanding.
